This is a readme on how to contribute to the workflow of the Ctrip project.

Besides directly contributing to the code to finalize the project, we appreciate your improvement on the current AI multi-agent workflow. To be specific, the way to improve automation and minimize human intervention.

The dev_guide.md file in dev_log directory provides a step by step guide to help you build the Ctrip project from scratch by applying the multi-agent workflow. You may note that there are some TODOs and existing limitations of the current workflow, and may require human intervention to address them. You are welcome to contribute to the workflow by improving the prompt, introducing new agents and modifying the workflow.

Whenever you start a pull request, you are required to update the dev_log. You may add the problems you encounter, and your modifications to the current workflow (if any) in dev_log/dev_guide.md, and then write your modifications for both the code and the workflow to update.md.
For significant problems, feel free to open an issue.
